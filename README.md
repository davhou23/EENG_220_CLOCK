# EENG_220_CLOCK
AURTHORS: David Hout and Derek Elam
This was a class project for EENG 220 at the University of Indianapolis.

The following paragraph is a breif summary of what our project is.

  We will be creating an alarm clock for our EENG 220 project 
with our FPGAs. We will be using an external 7 segment display 
clock to display the time. A switch will be added to set the 
alarm to either on or off mode. A Buzzer will be used to sound 
once a selected time is hit. Even when the alarm is set to off, 
it still keeps the time value of the alarm so it doesnâ€™t have 
to be set again. We will be using two rotary encoders to set the 
hour and minute digit. In order to set the time for the clock, 
we would have a button that turns on the time set mode. Once this 
is enabled you can use the rotary encoders to set the time. 
If you want to set the time for the clock, you would need to 
have the alarm set to off. If you want to set the time of the 
alarm, then you would turn the alarm on. Once you have set the 
time you would press the button again to turn off the time set 
mode. If the team gets this part of the project done sooner than 
expected, then we will add a second part to the project. The 
second part will be a timer that will display minutes and seconds.
This project was done using the DE10-Lite FPGA board.
